<h1>duplicates</h1>
<p>
  this site uses pseudo random numbers to generate packs; it has no knowledge
  of print runs. you can expect a number of duplicate rares and/or mythics per
  draft. let's calculate this number for the original ravnica block, which did
  not contain mythics:
</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem</a>
<blockquote>In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox[1]
  concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some
  pair of them will have the same birthday.</blockquote>

<p>
  the birthday problem is a nice start, but we are concerned with the expected
  number of duplicates, not the probability of a duplicate occuring
</p>

<a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/35791/birthday-problem-expected-number-of-collisions">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/35791/birthday-problem-expected-number-of-collisions</a>
<blockquote>I am wondering how to find instead the expected number of people
  sharing a birthday in a group of n people.</blockquote>

...

<blockquote>so the expected number of people who share birthdays with somebody
  is n(1−(1−1/N)<sup>n−1</sup>).</blockquote>

<p>
  where N is the number of of equally possible birthdays, and n is the number
  of people. for our purposes, N is the number of rares in the set, and n is
  the number of people drafting
</p>

<p>
  now to plug in some numbers:
</p>

<pre>{`
  n = 8
  N = 88 (RAV), 55 (GPT), 60 (DIS)

  E(RAV) ≈ 0.615
  E(GPT) ≈ 0.964
  E(DIS) ≈ 0.888
  --------------
  E(SUM) ≈ 2.467`}
</pre>

<p>
  so, in an 8 player draft of the original ravnica block, you can expect about
  2.5 duplicate rares per draft
